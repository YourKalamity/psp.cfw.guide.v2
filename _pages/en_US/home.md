## What is Homebrew?
Homebrew is unofficial third-party software not authorized by the OEM to run on a system. These software can range from games, media players, photo printers, emulators and other software. The PSP also has a PS1 emulator built in by Sony but users must mod their systems before they can run their own backups


## What does this guide install?

This guide will install the latest PRO Custom Firmware, which allows users to run any PSP program from your console. At the time of writing, v6.61 is the latest iteration and has the highest level of compatibility with Homebrew
## What should I know before starting?

- Homebrew allows you to modify your system, which could easily result in a brick if done improperly.
- You will need a Memory Stick Pro Duo formatted to FAT32 with at least 4GB of storage. The maximum the PSP can support is 32GB and is the recommended size to get
- Alternatively, you may purchase a microSD to MS Pro Duo adapter which will perform the same
- You will also need a method accessing the card which can be done by either
- - Connecting the PSP system via the USB Port located on the top (PSP 1000/2000/3000/E1000) and opening USB Connection located in the Settings column of the XMB
- - Using a card reader

Get started by [installing PRO CFW](installing-PRO-CFW).
