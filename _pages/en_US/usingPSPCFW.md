## Playing Game backups

- PSP game backups come in 2 formats, .iso and .cso
- These can be obtained by dumping UMDs to the memory card using homebrew applications
- .cso files are the compressed version of .iso and take up less space but at the cost of longer load times.
- To run ISO and CSO files
  1. Create a folder called ISO on the root of your memory card
  2. Transfer the .iso and .cso files into it
  3. Open them through the memory stick icon on the game column

## Homebrew

- To install new homebrew to your PSP you will need to obtain a folder containing at least an EBOOT.BIN file.
- If you are given just an EBOOT.PBP file then placing it into a folder will yield the same result.
- To install them
     1. Place the folder containing the EBOOT.BIN into PSP/GAME
- They should appear in the memory stick icon after being placed correctly.

### Emulators

- There are many emulators that can run on the PSP
- Simply find the system you wish to run and follow the instructions
